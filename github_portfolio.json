          "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nThe ESP3D project has amazing flexibility. I would like to add support for hpgl pen plotters. These great machines are just too good to let die out. Adding the possibility of using these machines within the ESP3D framework would open up features such as wifi connectivity, SD plotting and all the other fantastic features that ESP3D has to offer\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe integration of hpgl commands into some of the panels such as JOG and status. The core features like the SD file system and terminal are already 99% usable and only need minor changes to use.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI had started a software that has similar features. It was not even nearly as stable as ESP3D . After looking at the ESP3D project I realized I was just trying to re-invent the wheel. The required changes have already been tried and tested so should be good to add to ESP3D. The changes to the UI would be very much within the framework of the existing ESP3D UI and would not require a total re write.\r\n\r\nBasic notes here \r\nhttps://github.com/ithinkido/ESP3D/tree/3.0_HPGL/HPGL\r\n\r\n",

Try changing some of that. You could, for example, change the icon that displays when the action is running.\n- Change the `MY_NAME` environment variable to use your name instead of Mona's in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.\n- Change the contents of `entrypoint.sh` to do output a different message.\n\nOutside of this repository:\n- Review the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-actions) on the GitHub Developer site. \n- Use existing actions from the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions).\n- Use existing actions from GitHub's [official list](https://github.com/actions).\n- Use actions created by others in [awesome-actions](https://github.com/sdras/awesome-actions).\n\nNow...[what will you learn next](https://lab.github.com/courses)?\n",

I try out official Marlin branch, it compiles without a problem and I also able flash this binary to dev board but big question if  I upload code to some esp32 dev board like \"DOIT Esp32 DevKit v1\" project will run without a connection to additional hardware?\r\nfor my test, it's just crashed and I try to understand this because some hardware must be connected and if it's missing I must expect that it crashes?\r\nI like the idea to use esp32 as the controller board\r\n\r\nif it's expected that devices won't' boot without additional hardware what is the minimum required hardware?\r\nI plan to create some minimal with SPI drivers \r\nAnd want start from some minimal hardware connected to this board\r\n",
