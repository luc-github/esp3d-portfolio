      "body": "Time to define what host feature will be:\r\nBasic description\r\n1 - Read Gcode from SD \r\n2- Send GCODE to printer FW via Serial\r\n3 - Wait for ack\r\n4 - if ack go to 1 / if error go to 2\r\n\r\nNow need to clarify each part : \r\n* Point 1  is no issue so far: just store file name / currentline \r\n* Point 2 need more elaborate:\r\n1 - add Line numbering in command\r\n`N1 G28`\r\nReset the line numbering is M110 N0 on Repetier / Marlin / Smoothiware\r\n2 - add command checksum for safety (all command char are XOR+*+checksum calculated)\r\n`N20 M105*20`\r\n* Point4 : ack always use ok +line number \r\n`ok 20`\r\nif error on line number or checksum you get\r\n`resend 20`\r\n\r\nNot sure if special command need to be handled (like @pause) right now as it is not a host that have direct UI, but will be when Oled Screen is enabled as well as rotary encoder is supported.\r\n\r\nOne command is key: Emergency stop, to stop sending commands ans stop printer FW\r\n",
