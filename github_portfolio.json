I can send and I receive data from the cnc through the USB SERIAL port.. The problem is that there is a delay of about 1 second between the sending of the command and the execution from cnc device, this is very clear visible when a file is executed, all commands are executed with a delay between each other and the whole process is interrupted. I tested with communication from my computer directly to port 23 of an esp3d-tft board the delay remains, I tested using the web interface the delay remains on sending commands or executing file. If connect the machine directly to the computer with a usb cable everything works fine.\r\n\r\nCan someone tell me if this is a bug or if I missed something when compiling the code.\r\n\r\nI apologize for my bad English.",

The xml contains the real device type but the search target header is \r\n\"ST: upnp:rootdevice\"\r\n\r\nSo setting the device SSDP.setDeviceType() to say upnp:rootdevice works for discovery to start but fails because the xml device info schema will contain the wrong device type.\r\n\\<deviceType\\>upnp:rootdevice\\</deviceType\\>\r\n\r\nIn my case my actual device type is \"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:Basic:1\" but I need to respond to \"upnp:rootdevice\" and \"ssdp:all\" also the search term reply header is supposed to be the same as the ST in the search regardless of the actual device type. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is best handled in a callback of some type? The ability to respond to multiple device types is a good feature but in most cases just one is enough provided the above rootdevice and ssdp:all are also returning a valid reply.\r\n\r\n",
