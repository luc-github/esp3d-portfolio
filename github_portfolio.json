Forgive me, but I forgot to delete the file before committing the pull request. You can remove the file manually.\r\nI set the version to 2.1.3c0, which means it works the same as your 2.1.3b0 but has some appearance changes (c = custom). If you preffer to continue the beta numbering, simply change it to 2.1.3.b1.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> **The operation and functionality of the user interface have not changed.**\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> **The code was repeatedly compiled and tested on a test ESP01s and finally tested on a second ESP01s placed in the printer. I found no defects.**\r\n\r\n### The changes are best seen in the pictures below.\r\nBefore changes:\r\n<img width=\"1903\" height=\"1196\" alt=\"2 1 3b0_Dashboard\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77fb9a52-e5ee-46da-a1c3-ab15967de4d4\" />\r\nAfter changes:\r\n<img width=\"1903\" height=\"1120\" alt=\"2 1 3c0_Dashboard\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/748dd0aa-1ede-418a-ade3-5375700ca6ac\" />\r\n",

This patch adds a new state to skip over OWS.\r\n\r\n* MX delay is only producing even seconds 0, 1, 2 etc.\r\nThis patch more accurately represents the specification. 'should be delayed a random duration between 0 and this many seconds to balance load'. The current code frequently returns 0 when choosing a random number between 0 and MX. Changing to ms allows for more entropy in delay between competing devices.\r\n\r\n* Save ST the same as _respondToAddr to respond with the same ST for the query.\r\n\r\n* Fix a debug formatting. Added port to debug report.\r\n\r\n* Update README.md\r\n\r\n* Improve USN and ST headers to closer match rfc. Echoing back the correct answer for the request for root or all. Testing with gupnp-universal-cp and a custom schema because the baked in schema still needs refactoring to be usable.\r\n\r\n* Better to process the entire HTTP body. If we parse the ST header and it is a mismatch then we can abort else it is better to process the entire header.\r\n\r\n* Warnings for dummy case STRIP so do just like with START just add it. Remove _all not going to do it that way.\r\n\r\n* Added TX queue. Added limits to packet sleep time. For consistency updated _respondType in class constructor.\r\n\r\n* reorder class init members.\r\n\r\n* Fixed compiler init warning.\r\n\r\n* Improve delay keep original delay when receiving multiple M-SEARCH queries.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Schema rewrite (#14)\r\n\r\nAdd functions to customize :\r\n* notify interval\r\n* server name and version\r\n* model description\r\n* uuid (root or full)\r\n* icons list\r\n* services list\r\nUpdate sample accordingly\r\nUpdate travis script\r\n\r\n* code format\r\n\r\n* Update library.properties\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: f34rdotcom <coder@f34r.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Luc <luc.@tech-hunters.com>",
