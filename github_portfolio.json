              "body": "Hello,\r\nI\u2019m using ESP3D version 2.x and want to send G-code commands like `G28 Z` and `M114 `through the HTTP API. I've tried requests in the format `http://<IP>/command?cmd=M114`, but I keep getting an `Invalid command` error. Could you clarify the correct way to format these requests for version 2.x? Also, if a password is needed, how do I set and include it in the requests?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help!",

Please describe.**\r\nI would like the ability to probe a surface and modify the loaded g code to account for surface inconsistencies\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like to be able to specify a grid of points that could be probed and generate a mesh. this mesh could then be used to correct uploaded gcode files to account for z height inconsistencies. This mesh should be able to be applied to multiple files via a button and the height should be able to be downloaded for future use.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nRight now the only work around is to attached the GRBL ESP32 to a computer and run one of the programs that can do this. These are\r\nOpenCNCpilot, bCNC, Universal G code Sender.\r\n\r\nIdeally I would like to be able to run this self contained\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

These great machines are just too good to let die out. Adding the possibility of using these machines within the ESP3D framework would open up features such as wifi connectivity, SD plotting and all the other fantastic features that ESP3D has to offer\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe integration of hpgl commands into some of the panels such as JOG and status. The core features like the SD file system and terminal are already 99% usable and only need minor changes to use.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI had started a software that has similar features. It was not even nearly as stable as ESP3D . After looking at the ESP3D project I realized I was just trying to re-invent the wheel. The required changes have already been tried and tested so should be good to add to ESP3D. The changes to the UI would be very much within the framework of the existing ESP3D UI and would not require a total re write.\r\n\r\nBasic notes here \r\nhttps://github.com/ithinkido/ESP3D/tree/3.0_HPGL/HPGL\r\n\r\n",

Adding the possibility of using these machines within the ESP3D framework would open up features such as wifi connectivity, SD plotting and all the other fantastic features that ESP3D has to offer\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nThe integration of hpgl commands into some of the panels such as JOG and status. The core features like the SD file system and terminal are already 99% usable and only need minor changes to use.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI had started a software that has similar features. It was not even nearly as stable as ESP3D . After looking at the ESP3D project I realized I was just trying to re-invent the wheel. The required changes have already been tried and tested so should be good to add to ESP3D. The changes to the UI would be very much within the framework of the existing ESP3D UI and would not require a total re write.\r\n\r\nBasic notes here \r\nhttps://github.com/ithinkido/ESP3D/tree/3.0_HPGL/HPGL\r\n\r\n",

              "body": "I am using ESP32-S3 DEV KIT N8R8 with esp3d-tft to communicate via wifi with my cnc 3030 prover max (with GRBL, USB port CH340) and the setting is made to communicate via USB SERIAL port. I can send and I receive data from the cnc through the USB SERIAL port.. The problem is that there is a delay of about 1 second between the sending of the command and the execution from cnc device, this is very clear visible when a file is executed, all commands are executed with a delay between each other and the whole process is interrupted. I tested with communication from my computer directly to port 23 of an esp3d-tft board the delay remains, I tested using the web interface the delay remains on sending commands or executing file. If connect the machine directly to the computer with a usb cable everything works fine.\r\n\r\nCan someone tell me if this is a bug or if I missed something when compiling the code.\r\n\r\nI apologize for my bad English.",

The xml contains the real device type but the search target header is \r\n\"ST: upnp:rootdevice\"\r\n\r\nSo setting the device SSDP.setDeviceType() to say upnp:rootdevice works for discovery to start but fails because the xml device info schema will contain the wrong device type.\r\n\\<deviceType\\>upnp:rootdevice\\</deviceType\\>\r\n\r\nIn my case my actual device type is \"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:Basic:1\" but I need to respond to \"upnp:rootdevice\" and \"ssdp:all\" also the search term reply header is supposed to be the same as the ST in the search regardless of the actual device type. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is best handled in a callback of some type? The ability to respond to multiple device types is a good feature but in most cases just one is enough provided the above rootdevice and ssdp:all are also returning a valid reply.\r\n\r\n",
