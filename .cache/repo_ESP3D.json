            "body": "Current protocol between printer and ESP3D use raw serial which is ok for GCODE communication but no really efficient for file transfer\r\nMore over if some output come from printer board due to auto send it bring some trouble on file transfer which is already slow\r\n\r\nCurrent MKS protocol encapsulate each command in a frame with specific header,  it also use 2 additionnal pins for notification/ack ,and different headers for GCODE / File transfer / Error, which make coexistance easier\r\nThis protocol allow 110KB/S transfer vs 0.4KB/S M28/M29 transfer and handle GCODE even during transfer.\r\nThat said current MKS protocol miss 2 things:    \r\n* CRC to ensure data are correct\r\n* resend process in case of corrupted data\r\n\r\nI think add a CRC32 should improve reliability and will only use couple of byte on each frame, and calculation should not affect too much performances.  if done when data is received\r\nBased on this crc, if any error happen then do a resend, if more than 2 resend is needed  on same packet, then automaticaly ask for decreasing baudrate to do more secure transfer. \r\n\r\nThis would need to add some code in Printer FW  but will ensure communication for file transfer as well as commands \r\nThis will be between esp3d and printer like on MKS Wifi so external progam won't be affected.\r\n\r\nI am considering to write a library that could be used to hook the serial wifi port, but this also means need a dedicated wifi port like BTT do for board or TFT or an available UART port  \r\nIf Serial port  is same as USB one, it won't work (e.g: Mega/Ramps and aux 1),  so I need to see if can handle raw serial in same time or consider it as limitation= no support of shared solution, may add custom GCODE  to switch from one mode to another ?\r\nIn addition it need 2 additional pins available.\r\n\r\nThis would allow to remove the need of supporting the slow and unreliable M28/M29 protocol but bring more work on ESP3D part by adding a daughter library / Serial protocol accross FW  (Repetier / Marlin / Smoothieware/ TBD...)\r\n\r\nAny feedback /comment is welcome  \r\n\r\n",
