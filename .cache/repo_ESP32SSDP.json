The xml contains the real device type but the search target header is \r\n\"ST: upnp:rootdevice\"\r\n\r\nSo setting the device SSDP.setDeviceType() to say upnp:rootdevice works for discovery to start but fails because the xml device info schema will contain the wrong device type.\r\n\\<deviceType\\>upnp:rootdevice\\</deviceType\\>\r\n\r\nIn my case my actual device type is \"urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:Basic:1\" but I need to respond to \"upnp:rootdevice\" and \"ssdp:all\" also the search term reply header is supposed to be the same as the ST in the search regardless of the actual device type. \r\n\r\nMaybe this is best handled in a callback of some type? The ability to respond to multiple device types is a good feature but in most cases just one is enough provided the above rootdevice and ssdp:all are also returning a valid reply.\r\n\r\n",
